              "[Document(page_content='Uniswap v3 Core\\nMarch 2021\\nHayden Adams\\nhayden@uniswap.orgNoah Zinsmeister\\nnoah@uniswap.orgMoody Salem\\nmoody@uniswap.org\\nRiver Keefer\\nriver@uniswap.orgDan Robinson\\ndan@paradigm.xyz\\nABSTRACT\\nUniswap v3 is a noncustodial automated market maker imple-\\nmented for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. In comparison to earlier\\nversions of the protocol, Uniswap v3 provides increased capital\\nefficiency and fine-tuned control to liquidity providers, improves\\nthe accuracy and convenience of the price oracle, and has a more\\nflexible fee structure.\\n1 INTRODUCTION\\nAutomated market makers (AMMs) are agents that pool liquidity\\nand make it available to traders according to an algorithm [ 5]. Con-\\nstant function market makers (CFMMs), a broad class of AMMs of\\nwhich Uniswap is a member, have seen widespread use in the con-\\ntext of decentralized finance, where they are typically implemented\\nas smart contracts that trade tokens on a permissionless blockchain\\n[2].\\nCFMMs as they are implemented today are often capital inef-\\nficient. In the constant product market maker formula used by\\nUniswap v1 andv2, only a fraction of the assets in the pool are\\navailable at a given price. This is inefficient, particularly when\\nassets are expected to trade close to a particular price at all times.\\nPrior attempts to address this capital efficiency issue, such as\\nCurve [ 3] and YieldSpace [ 4], have involved building pools that use\\ndifferent functions to describe the relation between reserves. This\\nrequires all liquidity providers in a given pool to adhere to a single\\nformula, and could result in liquidity fragmentation if liquidity\\nproviders want to provide liquidity within different price ranges.In this paper, we present Uniswap v3 , a novel AMM that gives\\nliquidity providers more control over the price ranges in which\\ntheir capital is used, with limited effect on liquidity fragmentation\\nand gas inefficiency.

This improves the pool’s\\ncapital efficiency and allows LPs to approximate their pre-\\nferred reserves curve, while still being efficiently aggregated\\nwith the rest of the pool. We describe this feature in section\\n2 and its implementation in Section 6.\\n•Flexible Fees : The swap fee is no longer locked at 0.30%.\\nRather, the fee tier for each pool (of which there can be\\nmultiple per asset pair) is set on initialization (Section 3.1).\\nThe initially supported fee tiers are 0.05%,0.30%, and 1%.\\nUNIgovernance is able to add additional values to this set.\\n•Protocol Fee Governance :UNIgovernance has more flexibility\\nin setting the fraction of swap fees collected by the protocol\\n(Section 6.2.2).\\n•Improved Price Oracle :Uniswap v3 provides a way for users\\nto query recent price accumulator values, thus avoiding the\\nneed to checkpoint the accumulator value at the exact be-\\nginning and end of the period for which a TWAP is being\\nmeasured.

All pools are created by the same\\nfactory contract. The factory contract initially allows pools to be\\ncreated at three fee tiers: 0.05%,0.30%, and 1%. Additional fee tiers\\ncan be enabled by UNI governance.\\n3.2 Non-Fungible Liquidity\\n3.2.1 Non-Compounding Fees. Fees earned in earlier versions were\\ncontinuously deposited in the pool as liquidity. This meant that\\nliquidity in the pool would grow over time, even without explicit\\ndeposits, and that fee earnings compounded.\\nInUniswap v3 , due to the non-fungible nature of positions, this\\nis no longer possible. Instead, fee earnings are stored separately\\nand held as the tokens in which the fees are paid (see Section 6.2.2).\\n3.2.2 Removal of Native Liquidity Tokens. InUniswap v1 andv2,\\nthe pool contract is also an ERC-20 token contract, whose tokens\\nrepresent liquidity held in the pool. While this is convenient, it\\nactually sits uneasily with the Uniswap v2 philosophy that any-\\nthing that does not need to be in the core contracts should be in the\\nperiphery, and blessing one “canonical\" ERC-20 implementation\\ndiscourages the creation of improved ERC-20 token wrappers. Ar-\\nguably, the ERC-20 token implementation should have been in the\\nperiphery, as a wrapper on a single liquidity position in the core\\ncontract.\\nThe changes made in Uniswap v3 force this issue by making\\ncompletely fungible liquidity tokens impossible. Due to the custom\\nliquidity provision feature, fees are now collected and held by thepool as individual tokens, rather than automatically reinvested as\\nliquidity in the pool.\\nAs a result, in v3, the pool contract does not implement the\\nERC-20 standard. Anyone can create an ERC-20 token contract in\\nthe periphery that makes a liquidity position more fungible, but\\nit will have to have additional logic to handle distribution of, or\\nreinvestment of, collected fees. Alternatively, anyone could create\\na periphery contract that wraps an individual liquidity position\\n(including collected fees) in an ERC-721 non-fungible token.\\n4 GOVERNANCE\\nThe factory has an owner , which is initially controlled by UNI\\ntokenholders.2The owner does not have the ability to halt the\\noperation of any of the core contracts.\\nAs in Uniswap v2 ,Uniswap v3 has a protocol fee that can be\\nturned on by UNI governance. In Uniswap v3 , UNI governance has\\nmore flexibility in choosing the fraction of swap fees that go to the\\nprotocol, and is able to choose any fraction1\\n𝑁where 4≤𝑁≤10,\\nor0. This parameter can be set on a per-pool basis.\\nUNI governance also has the ability to add additional fee tiers.\\nWhen it adds a new fee tier, it can also define the tickSpacing\\n(see Section 6.1) corresponding to that fee tier. Once a fee tier is\\nadded to the factory, it cannot be removed (and the tickSpacing\\ncannot be changed). The initial fee tiers and tick spacings supported\\nare0.05%(with a tick spacing of 10, approximately 0.10%between\\ninitializable ticks), 0.30%(with a tick spacing of 60, approximately\\n0.60%between initializable ticks), and 1%(with a tick spacing of\\n200, approximately 2.02%between ticks.', metadata={'page': 2.0, 'source': 'uniswap-v3.pdf'}),\n",

The Uniswap v3 core contracts are also\\nnon-upgradeable, with some parameters controlled by governance\\nas described in Section 4.\\n2 CONCENTRATED LIQUIDITY\\nThe defining idea of Uniswap v3 is that of concentrated liquidity :\\nliquidity bounded within some price range.\\nIn earlier versions, liquidity was distributed uniformly along the\\n𝑥·𝑦=𝑘 (2.1)\\nreserves curve, where 𝑥and𝑦are the respective reserves of two\\nassets XandY, and 𝑘is a constant [ 1]. In other words, earlier ver-\\nsions were designed to provide liquidity across the entire price\\nrange(0,∞). This is simple to implement and allows liquidity to\\nbe efficiently aggregated, but means that much of the assets held in\\na pool are never touched.\\nHaving considered this, it seems reasonable to allow LPs to\\nconcentrate their liquidity to smaller price ranges than (0,∞). We\\ncall liquidity concentrated to a finite range a position . A position\\nonly needs to maintain enough reserves to support trading within\\nits range, and therefore can act like a constant product pool with\\nlarger reserves (we call these the virtual reserves ) within that range.\\n𝑎𝑏\\n𝑐𝑦real𝑥real\\nXReservesYReservesvirtual reserves\\nFigure 1: Simulation of Virtual Liquidity\\nSpecifically, a position only needs to hold enough of asset Xto\\ncover price movement to its upper bound, because upwards price\\nmovement1corresponds to depletion of the Xreserves. Similarly,\\nit only needs to hold enough of asset Yto cover price movement\\nto its lower bound.

If the price ever\\nreenters the range, the liquidity becomes active again.\\nThe amount of liquidity provided can be measured by the value\\n𝐿, which is equal to√\\n𝑘. The real reserves of a position are described\\nby the curve:\\n(𝑥+𝐿√𝑝𝑏)(𝑦+𝐿√𝑝𝑎)=𝐿2(2.2)\\nThis curve is a translation of formula 2.1 such that the position is\\nsolvent exactly within its range (Fig. 2).\\n𝑎𝑏\\nXReservesYReservesvirtual reserves (2.1)\\nreal reserves (2.2)\\nFigure 2: Real Reserves\\nLiquidity providers are free to create as many positions as they\\nsee fit, each on its own price range. In this way, LPs can approximate\\nany desired distribution of liquidity on the price space (see Fig. 3\\nfor a few examples). Moreover, this serves as a mechanism to let\\nthe market decide where liquidity should be allocated. Rational LPs\\ncan reduce their capital costs by concentrating their liquidity in\\na narrow band around the current price, and adding or removing\\ntokens as the price moves to keep their liquidity active.\\n2.1 Range Orders\\nPositions on very small ranges act similarly to limit orders—if the\\nrange is crossed, the position flips from being composed entirely\\nof one asset, to being composed entirely of the other asset (plus\\naccrued fees). There are two differences between this range order\\nand a traditional limit order:\\n•There is a limit to how narrow a position’s range can be.\\nWhile the price is within that range, the limit order might\\nbe partially executed.\\n•When the position has been crossed, it needs to be with-\\ndrawn.

              "[Document(page_content='Despite the rapid adoption of EHRs, \\nthere has not been a commensurate reduction in fragmentation and automation in the realm of billing.\\nThis is ironic considering that the \\nconventional wisdom among physicians is that billing is the primary purpose of EHRs in the first place. Standards for Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which allow software from different devices to exchange information securely and efficiently, may help alleviate some inefficiencies in billing. (We’ll discuss APIs further below.) For instance, an API may give a payer access directly to the information it needs to process a claim, rather than having to exchange faxes with the doctor’s office. The change in recent years from transaction-oriented reimbursement schemes, in which health care providers are paid for, and have to document, each act they perform, to those that emphasize the value of health care services to the patient, has lowered the volume of forms and documentation somewhat. Fewer practices are required to document things that they’ve done to get reimbursement.Physicians: Junk the fax machine. Every doctor’s office ought to embrace electronic communications. “For the 30 to 40 percent of American practices that are unwilling to give up the fax machine and are unwilling to receive electronic payments, perhaps there has to be a culture shift,” Gilliland told symposium attendees. Federal and private payers may be able to help in this regard by providing incentives. Even simple changes such as physician practices shifting to a payer’s portal website, rather than insisting on using faxes and paper payments, would create significant efficiencies. \\nPhysicians must start accepting \\nelectronic payments. Many doctors’ offices are reluctant to allow payers to transfer funds electronically for fear that they would also be able to make withdrawals. Payers need to support physician practices. Providing in-kind support to providers in exchange for sharing clinical and claims information would help practices adopt technology. For instance, payers could provide a dashboard back to providers so that they can get analytical insights about their utilization and costs. This would have the added benefit of helping them make the transition to value-based billing.  \\nCreate common standards across \\npayers. If health care insurers and other payers agree on a common set of data and formats, they would greatly reduce the bureaucratic burden on small practices who now must fill out so many different forms. \\nStreamline pre-authorization. \\nDecreasing the hassle and time to process claim pre-authorizations would reduce inefficiencies and \\n2.3.Future of EHR\\n4.Gilliland identified some \\npractical, short-term steps  \\nto help streamline billing: \\n1.\\n5.', metadata={'page': 10.0, 'source': 'electronic-health-records.pdf'}),\n",

During the measles outbreak, IT met with the hospital’s lawyers, quality-control personnel, nurses, and infectious disease experts to determine how best to modify EHRs to make them more useful in managing the crisis. The changes took a matter of hours to implement. \\nCentral to the success of Great Hudson \\nValley’s program is making analytics data available to physicians. Since the clinicians helped narrow down the list of priorities, it is important that they are able to access data they need to make appropriate decisions.\\nFor physicians and health care \\norganizations that handle Medicare and Medicaid patients, the federal government is beginning to move away from some of its more onerous requirements for documenting the patient-doctor interaction.\\nIts recent “Patients Over Paperwork”\\ninitiative, announced in June 2018, would consolidate some Medicare fee structures for outpatientvisits, reduce clerical tasks associatedwith coding and billing administration,and allow doctors and otherpractitioners to focus on documentedchanges since the patient’s last visitrather than re-documenting information. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimates that the new regulations would save nearly 30,000 hours spent on billing administration. If these changes are adopted, they might relieve some of the burden on physicians in the next few years. \\nInefficiencies in Billing \\nand Reimbursement \\nPhysicians and patients alike have their \\nfavorite anecdotes about the problems of the U.S. health care system. Many of these stories center on the process of billing and reimbursement. Terry Gilliland, MD, Senior Vice President and Chief Health Officer at Blue Shield of California, told the Stanford Medicine symposium that overhead for billing transactions accounts for 6 percent of a payer’s costs. One practice reported that it takes a trained registered nurse 45 minutes on average to get insurance pre-authorization for a CT scan. Another practice reported that, over the course of dealing with all of their different payers and care organizations, they are required to fill out 200 different forms. In general, health care billing in the U.S. is characterized by a pervasive fear of technology and inefficiency.\\n“This is an extremely fragmented \\nmanual process that is not benefitting many people, ” says Gilliland. \\nOne problem is a lack of automation \\nof manual processes. About a third of physician practices insist on doing business with paper forms and fax machines. A physician’s office might fill out a claims form on paper and fax it to the payer, who would pay someone to transcribe it into their system. Then the payer will identify information that is missing in the form but is needed to process a claim. The form then gets faxed back to the doctor’s  office, which addends it and faxes it back. The payer then has to pay someone to transcribe the information into the system. These kinds of inefficiencies drive up the cost of transactions.
